# subsync
Subsync is a super-easy way to help sync the timing between videos and their .srt files.

All the user has to do is figure out the delay once and then use subsync to fix it forever. Delays can be negative as well well as vary at different points in the video. Contrast this to the normal scenario in which the user has to press G or H to figure out and fix the delay each time he opens the video.

## Prerequisites
- Python 2.7

## Instructions
- Place `subsync.py` in the same directory as the .srt file.
- Run `subsync.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.
